Made this analog clock using html, css and javascript. Tried to make it glassmorphic by using the backdrop-filter blur and using backgrounds with bright colors and structures just like the one that I used.
Also using proper box shadows and translucent borders around the clock. 
And use different levels of transparency for different objects.
