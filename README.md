# Glassmorphism
In my this repo I will be uploading the projects that I recently made related to the new glassmorphism trend.
The major characteristics of this trend are:-
1) The Frosted glass effect using the blur effect [backdrop-filter:blur(_px);]
2) Vivid and Bright or maybe neon colours to higlight the blurred background.
3) A light border around the translucent buttons or the container or other objects.
4) Also one can also use multiple layers with different levels of transparency.
